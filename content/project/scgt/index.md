We perform numerical Lattice Quantum Field Theory calculations using Monte Carlo methods to solve the strong dynamics of many flavor systems and understand which ones are close to QCD and which ones have new properties that indicate the existence of near-conformal dynamics.

This research project is done with the Lattice Strong Dynamics collaboration and with the LatKMI collaboration.

For more details on the Lattice Strong Dynamics collaboration, see [LSD](http://lsd.physics.yale.edu/projects/).
