# Profile

I am an AI Researcher and Engineer at Arithmer Inc., a robotics and artificial intelligence startup in Tokyo, Japan.
My research topics are focused around applications of 3D computer vision to enhance automatic measurements and decision making processes based on high-dimensional data.

I am also a Visiting Scientist of the RIKEN Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences Program, and I collaborate on projects in Quantum Computing and Dark Matter theories.

My academic research was focused on understanding high energy strongly-coupled gauged theories, in particular in the context of extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, like Dark Matter physics or theories of Composite Higgs.
New discoveries are hinging on the theoreticians' ability to make predictions that can be tested by experimentalists, and that is precisely my goal.

In my free time I am working on projects related to low-energy nuclear physics, for example calculating nucleon-nucleon interactions or nuclear form-factors directly from the theory of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). In addition, I have been working on matrix models to study the gauge/gravity duality conjecture with the aim of understanding the possible intriguing relation between gauge theories and quantum gravity. In these projects I apply Machine Learning (ML) approaches to large amount of numerical data available from Monte Carlo simulations with the goal to make new and unexpected discoveries.

My expertise is in Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical simulations of quantum field theories, also known as Lattice Field Theory simulations, which use massively parallel supercomputers (CPU and GPU-based) around the world to solve the complex equations hiding the mysteries of particle physics.
