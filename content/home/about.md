<!-- # Biography

Since the early days of my life as a researcher, I have been interested in numerical methods applied to physics.
Before starting my PhD I performed research in Markov Chain and Monte Carlo algorithms, first applied to statistical systems like corrugated surfaces (two-dimensional) and then applied to quantum pure gauge theories (four-dimensional), with ties to theories of gravity.
I expanded my physics reach during my PhD, studying gauge theories with extra dimensions and quantum field theories with scalar and fermions.
Numerical methods were still at the center of my research.
In particular, I used Lattice Field methods to investigate strongly-coupled theories which are not amenable to perturbative analytical methods.
I was interested in gauge theories that could give rise to a particle similar to the Higgs boson, and that could extend our current knowledge of particle physics, currently summarized in the mathematically beautiful Standard Model.

During my first postdoctoral appointment I continued exploring gauge theories with Higgs candidates, but I also started studying dark matter theories.
Using numerical simulations of strongly-coupled theories, I investigated possible dark matter candidates that are tightly-bound heavy composite states, but also elementary dark matter candidates like the axion, which are very light. -->
